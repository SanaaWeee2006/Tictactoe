# Tictactoe
This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to compete against each other by taking turns to mark a 3x3 grid with their symbols ('X' or 'O') until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

Features:
1. Players input their moves by specifying row and column indices.
2. Automatically checks for wins in rows, columns, and diagonals.
3. Declares a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
4. Handles invalid inputs and ensures players select valid moves.
